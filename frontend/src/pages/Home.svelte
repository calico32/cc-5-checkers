      <ul>
        <section>
          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <li>
            Up to 4 people can play this game (starting a game with less than 4 players will fill
            the rest of the room with computers).
          </li>
          <li>The deck is shuffled and all cards are dealt to the 4 players.</li>
          <li>The player with the 3 of spades goes first.</li>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <li>Be the first player to play all your cards.</li>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Starting a turn</h3>
          <li>
            If there are no cards on the table/stack, you can play any number of any cards, but you
            cannot play different cards (i.e. three jacks is valid, but placing 4, 5, and 6 isn't).
          </li>
          <li>
            The next player can play a card of the same quanitity and the same or higher value.
            (i.e. if the first player places two fives ðŸ‚¥ ðŸ‚µ, you may only place two same/higher value
            cards like two sixes ðŸƒ† ðŸƒ–). You may also pass your turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Card hierarchy is A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, ace being highest and 3 being
            lowest. 2 is special and is used for flushing.
          </li>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Ending a turn</h3>
          <li>Turns keep going until everyone else passes.</li>
          <li>
            If everyone passes their turn, the pile is cleared and the player who last played goes
            first.
          </li>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Flushing</h3>
          <li>Playing a 2 flushes (clears) the card pile.</li>
          <li>
            If a card is on the top of the pile and you have enough cards to complete the set of 4
            (make the top 4 cards the same), you may place then and flush the pile even if it is not
            your turn.
          </li>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Reversal</h3>
          <li>
            Placing a duplicate of a card will reverse the turn order (e.g. if there is a 3 on the
            pile and you place another 3, the turn order will reverse).
          </li>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Controls</h3>
          <li>Clicking a card will select it to be played.</li>
          <li>Click the center pile to place selected cards.</li>
